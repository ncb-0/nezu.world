Originally started by online artist & friend [Mushbuh](http://www.mushbuh.com/), [itemLabel](https://itemlabel.com) is a "revenge-based company" selling collectible toys, hoodies, bags, hats, T-shirts, etc.—all original.

I've secretly low-key done work for itemLabel here and there, but this time it's in a big enough way to be worth an entry :p

### "heaven shirt", 2022

In October 2022, itemLabel released "Shirt Capsule 2"—a collection featuring 4 new T-shirts and 2 new water bottles, in collaboration with various talented artists and designers. If you want to see the other artists' contributions, you can find them in the [Twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/itemLabel/status/1585692998054051857)!

My design is shown below. I was given total free reign, so long as it included itemLabel characters in some way. I imagined waking up in a meadow of blooming [Sucklets](https://itemlabel.com/products/sucklet), and watching the [Bad Guy](https://itemlabel.com/products/bad-guy-plush) sun rise over the land. Where am I?!

"heaven shirt" is custom-manufactured, with a high quality 4-colour screenprint on the front. [Buy yours here](https://itemlabel.com/products/heaven-t-shirt)—if it's still in stock, at least.

If you have one and wanna show it off, send pics to [mel@nezu.world](mailto:mel@nezu.world)~ Or just mention [me](https://twitter.com/ncb0_) or [itemLabel](https://twitter.com/itemlabel) on Twitter, I guess.
