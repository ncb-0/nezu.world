Founded by my friend [Mushbuh](http://www.mushbuh.com/), [itemLabel](https://itemlabel.com) is a brand making and selling original toys and apparel.

## "Heaven shirt" (2022)

In October 2022, itemLabel released "Shirt Capsule 2"—a new line of merch, made in collaboration with various talented artists. The other artists' contributions can be found in the [Twitter announcement](https://twitter.com/itemLabel/status/1585692998054051857).

I had a lot of fun with my design—shown below. I imagined waking up in a meadow of blooming [Sucklet](https://itemlabel.com/products/sucklet) flowers, and watching a [Bad Guy](https://itemlabel.com/products/bad-guy-plush) sun rise over the land… where am I?!

"Heaven shirt" is custom-manufactured, with a high quality 4-colour screenprint on the front. ~~Buy yours here—if it's still in stock, at least.~~ _It isn’t._

If you have one and wanna show it off, send pics to [hello@nezu.world](mailto:hello@nezu.world)~ Or just mention [me](https://twitter.com/ncb0_) or [itemLabel](https://twitter.com/itemlabel) on Twitter.
