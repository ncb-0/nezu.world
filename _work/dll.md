"i die a lovely life" / "DLL" is a short yuri visual novel I created in roughly 2 weeks for the [2022 VN Cup](http://visualnovel.neocities.org). It won bronze. So maybe you should [download it here](http://nezita.itch.io/dll)?

### summary

Long distance girlfriends Uni and NuÃ±a are aching to meet, but neither of them can afford the plane tickets. Willing to do anything for money, Uni participates in a research study to have her brain uploaded into a computer... irreversibly?! Oops. But we can still hook up though, right? ðŸ˜—
