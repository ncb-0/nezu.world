DollHouse is a high-BPM hardcore PLUR rave run by T4T lesbian DJs [dustBunny](https://soundcloud.com/xxdustbunnyxy) and [Cherry Chip](https://soundcloud.com/christiearson). Pulled that near-verbatim from [their Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dollhouse4ever/), because I couldn't describe it better myself. :P

It feels like an IRL version of [CONEJOBEAT](/work/conejobeat)‚Ä¶ nearly everyone is queer and we all have diverse tastes for underground music and fashion.

## Flyer (March 2021)

As a graphic designer, I'm very literal. So, when I was asked to design a flyer for a cute rave called "DOLLHOUSE", well, the result explains itself. It's a dollhouse full of dancing animals. üçµ
