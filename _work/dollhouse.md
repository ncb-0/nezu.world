This year, I've found myself among a community of ravers called DollHouse—hosted by my friends [dustBunny](https://soundcloud.com/xxdustbunnyxy) and [Cherry Chip](https://soundcloud.com/christiearson). It feels like an IRL version of [CONEJOBEAT](/work/conejobeat)… nearly everyone is queer and we all have diverse tastes for underground music and fashion.

I'm still a noob DJ and have only played one set here, but I had the pleasure of designing the flyer for our rave in March 2022:
