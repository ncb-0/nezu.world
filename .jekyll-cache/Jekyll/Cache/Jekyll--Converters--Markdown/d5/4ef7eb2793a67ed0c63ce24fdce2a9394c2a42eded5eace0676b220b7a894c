<p>The students of <a href="http://esainfo.ca">Etobicoke School of the Arts</a> run a fashion show each year showcasing students' designs and artworks, as well as a magazine (Crushed Magazine) with photos of designs made for the show and fashion essays.</p>

<p>In 2019, the school got the opportunity to host the show on a much larger scale â€” Cloverdale Mall provided funding and a massive space to work with. As the design director I designed a website, posters, programs, and an 80+ page magazine â€” all featuring custom type. I DJ'd on the day of the event (April 25th).</p>

<h2 id="crushed-2">Crushed #2</h2>

<p>In 2018, the EFS heads put together Crushed Magazine, showcasing photos of student designs and artworks from the show. In 2019, I designed and edited Crushed #2 â€” 80+ pages of student fashion photos and essays. Custom Crushed logotype is featured on the cover. Magazine is typeset in sb-studio, an early unreleased version of my sb-spec typeface.</p>
