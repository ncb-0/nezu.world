I"‘<p>Originally started by online artist &amp; friend <a href="http://www.mushbuh.com/">Mushbuh</a>, <a href="https://itemlabel.com">itemLabel</a> is a â€œrevenge-based companyâ€ selling collectible toys, hoodies, bags, hats, T-shirts, etc.Â â€” all original.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve secretly low-key done work for itemLabel here and there, but this time itâ€™s in a big enough way to be worth an entry :p</p>

<h3 id="heaven-shirt-2022">â€œheaven shirtâ€, 2022</h3>

<p>In October 2022, itemLabel released â€œShirt Capsule 2â€Â â€” a collection featuring 4 new T-shirts and 2 new water bottles, in collaboration with various talented artists and designers. If you want to see the other artistsâ€™ contributions, you can find them in the <a href="https://twitter.com/itemLabel/status/1585692998054051857">Twitter announcement</a>!</p>

<p>My design is shown below. I was given total free reign, so long as it included itemLabel characters in some way. I imagined waking up in a meadow of blooming <a href="https://itemlabel.com/products/sucklet">Sucklets</a>, and watching the <a href="https://itemlabel.com/products/bad-guy-plush">Bad Guy</a> sun rise over the land. Where am I?!</p>
