I"=<p>Since 2020, I've been designing fonts on the low. I'm still adding finishing touches and figuring out ways to sell/distribute them, but here are some samples.</p>

<p>In 2020, I attempted to start a type foundry named SB Int'l — the URL was sbintl.cc — but I wasn't happy with the branding and wasn't ready to commit to it, so it's been inactive. I'm planning to start up a new outlet for my fonts named <em>Typemouse</em></p>

<h1 class="mega" contenteditable="true" style="font-weight:600;">I’m an editable sample of tm-mega!</h1>
