I"b<p>Since 2020, I've been designing fonts on the low. I'm still adding finishing touches and figuring out ways to sell/distribute them, but here are some samples.</p>

<p>In 2020, I attempted to start a type foundry named SB Int'l — the URL was sbintl.cc — but I wasn't happy with the branding and wasn't ready to commit to it, so it's been inactive.</p>

<p>I'm slowly planning a new type foundry called TYPEMOUSE — all fonts listed on this site with the prefix "tm-" are designed by me, and will eventually be up for sale.</p>
