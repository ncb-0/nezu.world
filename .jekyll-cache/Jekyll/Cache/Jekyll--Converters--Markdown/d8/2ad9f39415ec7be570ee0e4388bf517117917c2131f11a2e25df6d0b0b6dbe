I"<p>Originally started by online artist &amp; friend <a href="http://www.mushbuh.com/">Mushbuh</a>, <a href="https://itemlabel.com">itemLabel</a> is a “revenge-based company” selling collectible toys, hoodies, bags, hats, T-shirts, etc. — all original.</p>

<p>I’ve secretly low-key done work for itemLabel here and there, but this time it’s in a big enough way to be worth an entry :p</p>

<p>In October 2022, itemLabel released “Shirt Capsule 2” — a collection featuring 4 new T-shirts and 2 new water bottles, in collaboration with various talented artists and designers. If you want to see the other artists’ contributions, you can find them in the <a href="https://twitter.com/itemLabel/status/1585692998054051857">Twitter announcement</a>!</p>

<p>My contribution to the Capsule is shown below. I was given total free reign over the design, so long as it included itemLabel characters in some way. I imagined waking up in a meadow of blooming <a href="https://itemlabel.com/products/sucklet">Sucklets</a>, and watching the <a href="https://itemlabel.com/products/bad-guy-plush">Bad Guy</a> sun rise over the land.</p>
